## When to use If-else if-else over switch statements

A switch is really saying "pick one of these based on this variables value" but an if statement is just a series of boolean checks.


int value = // some value
if (value == 1) {
    doThis();
} else if (value == 2) {
    doThat();
} else {
    doTheOther();
}

This would be much better represented as a switch as it then makes it immediately obviously that the choice of action is occurring based on the value of "value" and not some arbitrary test.

concerning Speed:
Switch statements often perform faster than if-else constructs (but not always).
